abstract="Music composition is a delicate and disciplined art form that is tedious and repetitive. In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time.",

abstract="Several Sign Language (SL) systems have been developed using various technologies: Kinect, armbands, and gloves. Majority of these studies never considered user experience as part of their approach. With that, we propose a new framework that eases usability by employing two-arm gestural electromyography instead of typical vision-based systems see Fig.Â 5. Interactions can be considered seamless and natural with this way. In this preliminary study, we conducted focus group discussions and usability tests with signers. Based on the results of the usability tests, 90{\%} of respondents found the armband comfortable. The respondents also stated that the armband was not intrusive when they tried to perform their sign gestures. At the same time, they found it aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, we produced an initial prototype from this experiment setup and tested them on several conversational scenarios. By using this approach, we enable an agile framework that caters the needs of the signer-user.",
